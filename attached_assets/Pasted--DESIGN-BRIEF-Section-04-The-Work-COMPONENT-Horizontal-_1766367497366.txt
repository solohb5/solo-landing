**DESIGN BRIEF: Section 04 — The Work**

---

**COMPONENT: Horizontal Scroll Gallery**

A horizontally scrolling showcase of project cards. Should be easy to add new projects — just drop in a screenshot and link.

---

**BEHAVIOR:**

- Horizontal scroll on desktop (drag or scroll wheel when hovering)
- Swipe on mobile
- Smooth momentum scrolling
- Each card has independent color reveal (grayscale → color on hover)
- Clicking a card opens the live site in new tab

---

**EACH PROJECT CARD:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ● ● ●                              │
│  [SCREENSHOT WITH COLOR REVEAL]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
CLIENT NAME                       YEAR
Role / Description       What We Did
```

- Browser mockup frame (dark, minimal, three dots)
- Screenshot inside with grayscale default, color reveals on hover
- Client name left, year right
- Description left, services right
- Whole card links to live site

---

**DATA STRUCTURE:**

```js
const projects = [
  {
    name: "Jovanny Jones",
    role: "Executive Coach",
    year: "2024",
    services: "Brand / Web / Copy",
    screenshot: "/images/jovanny.png",
    url: "https://jovannyjones.com"
  },
  // Add more here
]
```

That's it. Add to the array, it appears in the gallery.

---

**PLACEHOLDER CARD (when less than 4 projects):**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│           YOUR BRAND HERE           │
│                ■                    │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Links to Begin / waitlist form. Subtle CTA.

---

**SIZING:**

- Cards: ~400-500px wide on desktop, ~85vw on mobile
- Gap between cards: 32px
- Section has horizontal padding so first/last cards peek from edges

---

**PROGRESS INDICATOR (optional):**

Small dots or thin progress bar below gallery showing scroll position. Not required but nice for 4+ projects.

---

**DONE.**

Hand this to the team. When you get a new client, you add one object to the array and drop a screenshot in the folder.
