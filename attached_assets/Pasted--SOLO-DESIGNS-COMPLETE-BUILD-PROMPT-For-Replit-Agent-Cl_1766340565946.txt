# SOLO DESIGNS — COMPLETE BUILD PROMPT

**For: Replit Agent / Claude Code**

---

## ROLE

You are an elite web developer who builds Awwwards-quality websites. Your work is indistinguishable from $50K agency output. You understand that premium isn't about adding features — it's about restraint, craft, and obsessive attention to detail.

---

## THE PROJECT

Build a single-page landing site for **Solo Designs** — a boutique web design studio.

**The philosophy:** Everything is still. One thing is alive. That's enough.

**The signature:** The square in the Solo logo pulses like a heartbeat — the only animation on the entire site. This creates a sense that the brand is alive, breathing, waiting.

## THE HEARTBEAT ANIMATION

This is the ONLY animation on the site. Everything else is static.

**For CSS (if square is a div/span):**
```css
@keyframes heartbeat {
  0%, 100% { 
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 rgba(201, 162, 39, 0);
    filter: brightness(1);
  }
  50% { 
    box-shadow: 0 0 24px rgba(201, 162, 39, 0.5);
    filter: brightness(1.1);
  }
}

.square {
  animation: heartbeat 1.2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

**For SVG (if using the SVG path):**
```css
@keyframes heartbeat-svg {
  0%, 100% { 
    filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0 rgba(201, 162, 39, 0));
    opacity: 1;
  }
  50% { 
    filter: drop-shadow(0 0 16px rgba(201, 162, 39, 0.6));
    opacity: 0.9;
  }
}

.square-svg {
  fill: #C9A227;
  animation: heartbeat-svg 1.2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

**Timing:** 1.2 seconds per beat (50 BPM — slower than resting heart rate, feels calm and confident)

**Where it appears:**
1. In the logo (the square after "SOLO") — can be separate SVG overlaid, or modify the logo SVG
2. Next to each section number (small, 8px rendered square)
3. Optionally: a small square in the bottom-right corner that persists on scroll

---

## HOVER INTERACTION: DIAMOND ROTATION

When hovering over interactive elements (CTA button, footer links), the nearest square rotates 45° to become a diamond.

```css
.square-interactive {
  transition: transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}

.square-interactive:hover {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}
```

**CTA Button Hover:**
- Border fills with gold (#C9A227)
- Text inverts to charcoal (#1A1A1A)
- Small square inside button rotates to diamond
- Transition: 200ms

---

## PAGE STRUCTURE

### SECTION: HERO (100vh)

```
[Solo logo — with pulsing square]

# Finally.

A website that feels like you.

↓ (scroll indicator — thin gold line, 40px, subtle pulse)
```

**Layout:**
- Logo: centered, 200px wide max
- "Finally." — centered, massive (120px desktop)
- Subhead — centered, 60% opacity
- Scroll indicator — absolute bottom, centered, 32px from bottom

**No navigation. No hamburger. Just this.**

---

### SECTION 01: THE TRUTH

```
01 ▪

You've built something real.
Your website doesn't show it.
```

**Layout:**
- Section number + pulsing square: left-aligned or centered
- Two lines of text, stacked
- Generous whitespace (160px padding top/bottom)

---

### SECTION 02: THE WAY

```
02 ▪

One conversation. We listen for what you can't say.
Two weeks. Brand, copy, site — built from that truth.
```

**Layout:** Same as Section 01

---

### SECTION 03: THE PROOF

```
03 ▪

[Browser mockup of Jovanny's site — glowing against dark background]

Jovanny Jones — Executive Coach

"I finally have a site that matches my work."
```

**Layout:**
- Browser mockup: max-width 900px, subtle glow effect (box-shadow: 0 0 60px rgba(201, 162, 39, 0.15))
- Name in gold, small caps
- Quote in Cormorant Garamond italic

**Browser mockup styling:**
```css
.browser-mockup {
  background: #0A0A0A;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 8px;
  box-shadow: 
    0 0 60px rgba(201, 162, 39, 0.15),
    0 25px 50px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

.browser-mockup::before {
  /* Three dots for browser chrome */
  content: "● ● ●";
  display: block;
  color: #333;
  font-size: 10px;
  letter-spacing: 4px;
  padding: 8px 12px;
}
```

---

### SECTION 04: THE DOOR

```
Your legacy deserves more than a template.

[ Begin → ]
```

**CTA Button:**
```css
.cta {
  border: 1px solid #C9A227;
  background: transparent;
  color: #F5F2EB;
  padding: 16px 48px;
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 500;
  letter-spacing: 0.1em;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 200ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}

.cta:hover {
  background: #C9A227;
  color: #1A1A1A;
}
```

---

### FOOTER

```
SOLO▪
hello@solodesigns.co
```

**Layout:**
- Centered
- Logo small (120px wide)
- Email as plain text link
- Padding: 80px top, 40px bottom
- Border-top: 1px solid #2A2A2A (subtle separator)

---

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Single HTML file** with embedded CSS and JS (or clean component structure if using React)
2. **Fully responsive** — mobile-first approach
3. **Smooth scroll behavior** — CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth`
4. **No external dependencies** except Google Fonts
5. **Performance:** No layout shift, minimal repaints
6. **Accessibility:** 
   - Proper heading hierarchy (h1 for "Finally", h2 for section titles)
   - Focus states on interactive elements
   - Reduced motion support: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` — disable heartbeat
7. **Semantic HTML5**

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before considering this complete:

- [ ] Does the heartbeat feel alive but not distracting?
- [ ] Is every piece of text readable without squinting?
- [ ] Does the site feel premium in the first 50 milliseconds?
- [ ] Is there enough whitespace to breathe?
- [ ] Does it work perfectly on mobile?
- [ ] Are transitions smooth (200ms, proper easing)?
- [ ] Is the hover diamond rotation subtle but noticeable?
- [ ] Does the CTA button invite clicking?
- [ ] Is there NOTHING that feels templated or generic?

## REFERENCE SITES (For Vibe)

- obys.agency — Numbered sections, Swiss minimalism
- locomotive.ca — Restraint, typography-forward
- baseborn.studio — Warm, boutique feel

## THE STANDARD

This site should make someone stop and say "holy shit, that's beautiful" — not because of flashy effects, but because every single pixel feels intentional.

The stillness is the statement. The heartbeat is the soul.

Build it.
