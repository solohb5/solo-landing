# SOLO DESIGNS — THE REAL SITE

## THE PHILOSOPHY

Everything is still. One thing is alive. That thing is a toy.

This isn't a website. It's an experience that makes people click, explore, and remember.

---

## REFERENCE

Study this: https://obys.agency

Note:
- The confidence of negative space
- Section numbers are HUGE (italic serif)
- Headlines are massive and editorial
- Thin horizontal rules as dividers
- Footer as a proper composition (columns: Socials, Address, Contact)
- The whole thing breathes

### Fixed Elements (Always Visible)
- **Top-left:** The pulsing square (24×24px). Clickable.
- **Top-right:** "Waitlist" — simple text link, no button styling
- **Bottom-right:** "SOLO" + small square (the full logo, smaller scale)

### Scrolling Content
Everything else scrolls normally beneath these fixed elements.

---

## THE COLOR MODE SYSTEM

Clicking the top-left square cycles through color modes:

| Mode | Background | Text | Accent | Square |
|------|------------|------|--------|--------|
| **Gold** (default) | #1A1A1A | #F5F2EB | #C9A227 | Gold |
| **Electric** | #1A1A1A | #F5F2EB | #00FF88 | Green |
| **Deep** | #1A1A1A | #F5F2EB | #4D7CFF | Blue |
| **Inverted** | #F5F2EB | #1A1A1A | #1A1A1A | Black |

On click:
1. Square rotates 90° (200ms, ease-out)
2. All accent colors transition smoothly (300ms)
3. Store preference in localStorage (optional)

The pulsing animation continues in whatever the current accent color is.

## PAGE SECTIONS

### HERO (100vh)

Center of screen:
```
Finally.
```
- Font: Cormorant Garamond, 300 weight
- Size: 140px desktop / 72px mobile
- Below it (subtle): "A website that feels like you."
- Size: 18px, 60% opacity

No scroll indicator. Let them discover.

---

### SECTION 01: THE TRUTH

```
01

You've built something real.
Your website doesn't show it.
```

- "01" — Large italic serif (Cormorant Garamond Italic), 120px, accent color
- Headline — 48px, regular weight
- Second line — 60% opacity
- Thin horizontal rule below (1px, 20% opacity)

---

### SECTION 02: THE WAY

```
02

One conversation.
Two weeks.
Everything changes.
```

- Same pattern as Section 01
- Each line on its own, stacked
- Generous line-height (1.4)

---

### SECTION 03: THE PROOF (The Magic Section)

```
03

[BROWSER MOCKUP - GRAYSCALE BY DEFAULT]
```

**THE COLOR REVEAL INTERACTION:**

The browser mockup contains a screenshot of the Jovanny Jones site. By default, it's completely grayscale (CSS filter: grayscale(100%)).

When the user moves their cursor over the image:
- A circular area around the cursor reveals the FULL COLOR version
- The circle is ~150px radius
- It follows the cursor smoothly
- The effect is like painting color onto a gray canvas

**Technical approach:**
- Two layers: grayscale on top, color beneath
- The grayscale layer has a CSS mask that's a radial gradient
- The mask position updates on mousemove
- On touch devices: tap and hold reveals color in that spot

Below the mockup:
```
Jovanny Jones — Executive Coach
"I finally have a site that matches my work."
```

---

### SECTION 04: THE DOOR (CTA)

Following the Obys pattern exactly:

```
04          LET'S BUILD  →
```

- "04" on the left (italic, accent color)
- "LET'S BUILD" massive (100px+), bold sans-serif
- Arrow icon on the right
- The whole thing is a link (mailto: or waitlist)
- Thin horizontal rule below

---

### FOOTER

Three columns, following Obys:

## THE PULSING SQUARE

```css
@keyframes heartbeat {
  0%, 100% { 
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 rgba(var(--accent-rgb), 0);
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  50% { 
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(var(--accent-rgb), 0.5);
    transform: scale(1.05);
  }
}

.pulse-square {
  width: 24px;
  height: 24px;
  background: var(--accent);
  animation: heartbeat 1.2s ease-in-out infinite;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: transform 200ms ease-out;
}

.pulse-square.clicked {
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}
```

The accent color is a CSS variable that changes when modes cycle.

## THE COLOR REVEAL EFFECT

```jsx
// Conceptual React approach
function ColorReveal({ imageSrc }) {
  const [mousePos, setMousePos] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  const [isHovering, setIsHovering] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <div 
      className="relative overflow-hidden"
      onMouseMove={(e) => {
        const rect = e.currentTarget.getBoundingClientRect();
        setMousePos({
          x: e.clientX - rect.left,
          y: e.clientY - rect.top
        });
      }}
      onMouseEnter={() => setIsHovering(true)}
      onMouseLeave={() => setIsHovering(false)}
    >
      {/* Color layer (underneath) */}
      <img src={imageSrc} className="w-full" />
      
      {/* Grayscale layer (on top, masked) */}
      <img 
        src={imageSrc} 
        className="absolute inset-0 w-full grayscale"
        style={{
          maskImage: isHovering 
            ? `radial-gradient(circle 150px at ${mousePos.x}px ${mousePos.y}px, transparent 0%, black 100%)`
            : 'none'
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## INTERACTIONS

| Element | Hover | Click |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Pulsing square | Glow intensifies | Rotates 90°, cycles color mode |
| Waitlist link | Underline appears | Goes to waitlist/mailto |
| CTA "LET'S BUILD →" | Arrow moves right 8px | Goes to waitlist/mailto |
| Footer links | Color → accent | Navigate |
| Browser mockup | Color reveals under cursor | — |

## WHAT DOES NOT EXIST

- Navigation menu
- Hamburger icon
- Multiple pages
- Contact form
- Social icons in header
- Trust badges
- Scroll animations on text (text just exists)
- Parallax
- Custom cursor
- Loading screen
- Cookie banner

---

## ASSETS NEEDED

1. `solo-logo-light.svg` — For bottom-right placement (cream version)
2. `solo-square.svg` — For top-left pulsing element (will be colored via CSS)
3. `jovanny-screenshot.png` — Full color screenshot of the case study site

---

## MOBILE CONSIDERATIONS

- Pulsing square: top-left, same position
- "Waitlist": top-right, same position  
- Logo: bottom-right, same position
- Color reveal: On tap-and-hold, color reveals in a static circle at touch point
- Color mode: Tapping square still cycles colors
- All text scales down proportionally

---

## THE FEELING

Someone lands. Black screen. Gold square pulsing in the corner. "Finally." in the center.

They scroll. Big italic numbers. Confident statements. 

They reach the screenshot. Gray. Dead. They move their cursor — color blooms like magic. They play with it. They get it.

They see "LET'S BUILD →" — massive, bold, undeniable.

They notice the square is still pulsing. They click it. The world turns electric green. They click again. Blue. Again. The whole site inverts to white.

They think: "This is different."

They click "Waitlist."
