## What Is This?

**Solo Designs** — A boutique web design studio building premium websites for personal brands.

**The Site:** A single-page landing experience that makes visitors feel the quality before reading a word.

**The Audience:** Speakers, coaches, creators, podcasters, founders — people who ARE the brand. They arrive from "BY SOLO DESIGNS" links in client footers (e.g., theedgeofhonor.com).

## The Philosophy

> "Everything is still. One thing is alive. That's enough."

The pulsing gold square is the heartbeat of the brand — the only persistent animation. Everything else is restraint, craft, and intentional stillness.

- Navigation menu / hamburger
- Multiple pages (keep it single-page)
- Social media icons
- Trust badges / logos
- Testimonial carousels
- Chat widgets
- Pop-ups

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Single animation (heartbeat) | Restraint IS the premium |
| No navigation | Single page, nowhere else to go |
| Form modal, not page | Keep flow, reduce friction |
| 4 color modes | Playful discovery, memorable interaction |
| Hollow text effects | Editorial, Obys-inspired sophistication |
| 3-week waitlist messaging | Creates demand, filters serious inquiries |

---

## The Standard

This site should make someone stop and say "holy shit, that's beautiful" — not because of flashy effects, but because every pixel feels intentional.

The stillness is the statement. The heartbeat is the soul.
